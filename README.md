## **CRYPTO PRICE ALERTER**

This program will check for cryptocurrencies price updates from a source (surely a **Rest API**).
We will be able to define rules, and when the rule is matched, the
application do an action (send an email, a telegram message, update a website, etc).
For example: _"If 'BTC' crosses the 50k USD then send a notification"._

I am doing this app to learn **programming and TDD**, _wish me luck_ ;).
